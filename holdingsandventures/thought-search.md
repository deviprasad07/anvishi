Thought Search was a semantic search engine, developed as a course project for the Semantic Web course. It was capable of natural language processing of unstructured data and store it as a semantic web on which SPARQL queries could be run. This enabled users to get more apt results to queries like "What course do Prof XYZ teach?".

The automated parking spot finder was an Arduino based system that notified on a web interface a grid of available parking spots categorized on permit levels. My responsibilities in this project included:

* Wrote code for the Arduino system to communicate the status of a spot to the central server.
* Designed and developed an API to "talk" with embedded devices to update parking spot status.
* Modified GUI to include parking lot switching.
* Developed an API using Twilio to receive texts and update the system based on the text content.

Below is a video demonstration of the working system.
