Generates an ANT based project for creating a Pentaho Kettle Step. Helpful for developers who don't want to write boilerplate code. Parameters such as Stepname, datatypes, etc are taken in through a GUI.

*You may need to change the SWT dependency for your Operating system. The default pom comes with SWT for OSX.*
