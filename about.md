Hi, I am Abhishek, a geek from Kolkata, now in Dallas working as a Software Engineer for Tango Analytics.

I am interested in algorithm design, implementation and distributed systems. During the day I work on the development and implementation of geospatial systems and during the night I switch to good old algorithm design apart from a myraid of other personal projects.
