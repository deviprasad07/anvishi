The automated parking spot finder was an Arduino based system that notified on a web interface a grid of available parking spots categorized on permit levels. My responsibilities in this project included:

* Wrote code for the Arduino system to communicate the status of a spot to the central server.
* Designed and developed an API to "talk" with embedded devices to update parking spot status.
* Modified GUI to include parking lot switching.
* Developed an API using Twilio to receive texts and update the system based on the text content.

Below is a video demonstration of the working system.
